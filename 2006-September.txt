Hi,

Is rox4debian suppose to work on etch, or is it just for sid?

I have a fresh etch installation, I added rox4debian repo and when I try to
install rox-desktop, I get this:

rox-desktop won't install cause zeroinstall-injector: Depends: python (< 2.4)
but 2.4.3-11 is installed

What should I do? I tried apt-get dist-upgrade without succes...

It should work on both.

Etch recently switched to python2.4, while the injector package still 
depends on python2.3. I've now uploaded the new injector-package as well 
as some other updated packages.
However, this also means that it won't work on sarge anymore. I think 
I'll need to set up a separate repository for stable.
Until then, everybody using debian stable must install the injector 
package from the 0install site.

Etch and Sid switched from Python 2.3 to Python 2.4 a short while ago;
due to the way it's set up, the zero install injector package for
Debian/stable wants Python 2.3. The answer is to install
zeroinstall-injector_0.22-2_all. As far as I can tell, that's actually
in the rox4debian source (maybe try apt-get updating again, it might
only have been added recently). Or else, you can get it from
<http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/zero-install/zeroinstall-injector_0.22-2_all.deb?download>.

Subject: [Rox4debian-users] DeviceHandler: Eject Audio CDs
Message-ID: <e57a1470609220048r45eaa3efsc6c9bf2bf39c1568@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks for DeviceHandler, it's a fantastic program, but...

My computer has no eject button on its cdrom drive, and so I need to
use software to eject any CD. It would be much easier if the AudioCD
handler had an 'eject' menu option. This probably applies to DVDs if
they don't already have one too; the only DVD I have at hand is
recognised as an data DVD. I would send in a patch, but the change is
so trivial it hardly seems worth it :)

(Also, by default, pmount mounts CDs/DVDs as noexec, which makes it
very difficult if you want to install software from one. AFAICT, the
way to change this is by giving the argument -e to pmount, which means
modifying DeviceHandler as well. Unless there's some configuration
file for pmount I'm unaware of, it would be convenient if an option
could be added to allow mounting them without noexec enabled.)

Thanks!

I've added it. Thanks for reporting!

I've added a checkbox for the exec (and sync) flag to the Volume
handler's options.

I'll release version 0.2.9 this weekend.
