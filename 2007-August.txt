I'm really sorry. There is some problem - I can send email but cannot
receive them. Is it a gmail problem? I don't know. Now I tried to
unsubscribe and subscribe again.

again sorry very much.

Ok, since I started this here I think I can finish and let you know
that gmail silently disables using it for mailing lists. The gmail
forums are full of complaining users, while gmail calls it a feature.

It's not possible to use gmail for mailing lists :(
