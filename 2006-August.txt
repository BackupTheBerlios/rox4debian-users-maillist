Hi!

I've got an older version of rox-desktop already
installed on this Debian sid box but I can't upgrade
to the latest version

------------------

root at KanotixROXBox:/home/n# apt-get install
rox-desktop
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean
that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using
the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet
been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is
extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report
against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the
situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  rox-desktop: Depends: rox-app-system but it is not
going to be installed
E: Broken packages

Any ideas?

Thanks

Hello,

When I do a "apt-get install rox-desktop" I get this error message:

I'm running Debian unstable. Any idea what's wrong?
