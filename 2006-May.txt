Subject: [Rox4debian-users] [ANNOUNCE] rox4debian 5 released
Message-ID: <447987AB.3050209@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

Hello!

I've uploaded version 5 of the rox4debian desktop package.

New features:
- wrappers for gnome-system-tools, synaptic and bum in Apps/Configuration
- inserted Audio-CDs and Video-DVDs are added to the panel and can be 
played by clicking them
- if cddb and cd-discid are installed, the Audio-CDs show up with the 
right label

Install instructions:
1) move ~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net out of the way. (Sorry, I'll try 
to avoid this next time!)

2) su

3) if you haven't already, add this to your /etc/apt/sources.list:
deb ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/rox4debian binary/

4) apt-get update

5) apt-get install rox-desktop


Greetings,

Dennis

Sorry Dennis, there are still a few kinks to be ironed
out in ROX4Debian. I'm happy to see TL has updated the
Debian install instructions but it seems strange that
he included an extract from one of DT's replies to one
of my e-mails without including what it is he's
replying to. Just looks a bit strange.

> Install instructions:

I did that before logging into v5 but there was still
no taskbar so I deleted all of ~/.config, ~/.cache and
~/.ivman before logging in again. After 0install did
its stuff I DID have a working Taskbar- yippee!

BUT

* ROX-Lib.png and SystemTrayN both failed to download
(didn't bother me though)

* I noticed that the Taskbar has its own libwnck so
two copies of libwnck (I go blind if I carry on like
this :) get downloaded. Why can't Taskbar use the same
libwnck as everything else?

* 2 ROX-Session icons appear on a fresh install- one
on the desktop and one on the panel. Just the panel
one for me please (and on the far left to keep
ex-windows addicts happy why not?)

* Why does the pager only default to be 3 desktops
wide? The unix standard has been 4 virtual desktops
since Christ used fvwm :D Bring back my 4th desktop!

Additionally, I'd like to see the Wallpaper app added
to the standard Apps link collection

We'll get there!

I tried, but I get a strange problem when I compile it with libwnck4 and 
then run it with the 0install-version of libwnck4:
The titles of the task entries go over their boundaries, which makes the 
Tasklist unreadable. As soon as this problem is solved, I will use 
libwnck4. Or the pager could use libwnck18 if that's possible.

I put the home-dir to the bottom left, because it's the item most often 
used, I suppose. Especially if you're working with inaccurate input 
devices it's the easiest to hit a corner of the screen. The left one 
seemed most common to me. The logout button looks good to me in the 
bottom right corner. Honestly, I don't know where to put it instead. 
Between all the "places" on the left it would feel very out-of-place. 
Its icon is also very intuitive, so even ex-windows-users will 
immediately get its meaning, regardless where it is.
I just put it on the pinboard because 6 items looked better to me than 5 
;-) Maybe I'll replace it with something else, but I don't know what yet.

Ok. But you can configure this quite easily by using 
Apps/Configuration/Window Manager. (Does it work?)

> Additionally, I'd like to see the Wallpaper app added

I'll have a look.

PS: Please use the rox4debian mailing list to avoid bothering all rox 
developers with problems related only to the debian package.

I gave up on packaging rox apps directly for debian, because it's a 
packaging and maintaining nightmare: Due to the debian policy, you have 
to spread an appdir across the whole filesystem and often patch the app 
in many places.
And you have to package every new version, which causes delays and often 
new problems.

So my new approach is to just put wrappers into 
/usr/share/rox-desktop/Apps which use the 0install-system in order to 
run/update. I even don't use the rox-filer package that is in debian. I 
just include a login-script that runs ROX-Session (and therefore 
ROX-Filer) through 0install.

The main advantages are that a user gets new versions of apps 
immediately when they are released, and that I can concentrate on other 
things (e.g. automounting via ivman/hal and auto-generated 
appdir-wrappers for the debian-menu-system) than repackaging apps and 
fix package-related bugs.

No, I don't have any connections to debian packagers.
I haven't tried to put it into debian, because its status is still quite 
experimental and I'm not an official debian-maintainer. Once it has 
reached a certain degree of stability I'll try to become one and add it.

However, I'm still not sure if it fully complies to the debian policy, 
because it uses 0install, which adds a different way of installing 
software to debian, which - as someone pointed out on the mailing list 
of the old rox-in-debian project - isn't allowed. I think I'll have to 
read the policy again.

It's because the code for setting an icon via SOAP rpc isn't in the 
filer yet.
Thomas, are you planning to include it? It's of good use for my project.

This means that ivman has crashed.
I've just uploaded version 1-6 (the previous was really "1-5", I called 
it "5" by mistake), so you can try upgrading and see if it still 
happens. After installing 1-6, you needn't remove any directory, just 
copy 
/usr/share/rox-desktop/defaults/rox.sourceforge.net/ROX-Session/Login 
into ~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net/ROX-Session, overwriting the old 
Login-script. Then add the "--debug" option to the last command in the 
file (the one that starts ivman).
When automounting stops to work, right-click on the Logout-button and 
choose "Message Log...". What does it say?
What are the last few lines of "~/.rox4debian/rox-desktop/disks.log"?

Hi Dennis!

I noticed the SOAP patch is in ROX now, so I expect
the next rox-desktop release will feature different
icons for different storage media?

I installed rox-desktop 1.6 but, strangely enough, I'm
having a different problem now.

If I have the ivman daemon disabled, USB automounting
works fine under KDE but doesn't work at all under
ROX. If I enable it, I get the same problem under both
KDE and ROX- the USB disc appears on the panel/desktop
and I can open it but I can't eject it as it says

---------------------------------------

Eject '/media/sda1'
Error: device /dev/sda1 was not mounted by you
eject: unmount of `/media/sda1' failed
eject failed

Done
There was one error.

------------------------------------------

As you recommended, I didn't delete ~/.config, .cache
and .ivman

After trying to eject the disc, I have this is my
ROX-session message log:

-------------------------------------------

ROX-Session started: Mon May 29 17:34:06 2006
(/usr/bin/openbox:3326): ObRender-WARNING **: Failed

I/O 
warning :

"/home/n/.config/openbox/menu.xml"

----------------------------

Maybe I should delete ~/.ivman and log back into ROX?
You said put a --debug at the end of ivman line in the
Login file- I presume you meant just before the & like
this-

/usr/bin/ivman -c
/etc/xdg/rox4debian.berlios.de/rox-desktop/ivman
--debug &

?

Yes, the code that asks rox to set icons is already in rox-desktop, just 
waiting for rox to support it. As soon as the next version of ROX-Filer 
is out, it should work!

Hi Dennis!

I noticed r4d 1.7 has been released so I just had a
very quick go with it. This time I deleted .config and
.cache to see what the new defaults are like. There
was no .ivman to delete

* Automounting seems to be working again (got to test
KDE with ivman enabled see if its still causing
problems- not that thats a major thing wrt this
project really)

* The png icons for ROX-filer and oroborox failed to
download (again, no biggie) and I got a big error that
I can't remember when rox-filer was downloading but it
downloaded OK. Also, everything seemed to get
downloaded twice for some reason?

* Glad to see the return of 4 desktops on the pager

* Please add Wallpaper to the default Apps

* It seems that you do include default run actions for
most file types but pretty much the only one that
works is using gnumeric for .xls files. For Abiword
(.doc), xpdf, pics (gthumb) I have to set it myself to


abiword "$@"

etc. By default, clicking on a .doc/.pdf/whatever will
open abiword/xpdf/whatever but the document will not
be opened too, just the program.

Thomas Leonard said that anyone can organise a new
release of rox-filer. I suppose we should ask on
rox-devel first to see if anybody else is already
doing it/wants to do it but if not might you create
the next release so we will have SOAP support?

Also, what packages need to be installed to get video
thumbnails working properly, especially for mplayer.

Subject: [Rox4debian-users] [ANNOUNCE] version 1-7 of rox-desktop out now
Message-ID: <447DE230.6030206@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

The version 1-7 of the rox-desktop package is now available.
The main change is that automounting is no longer directly integrated 
into the package, but separately available through 0install as 
application called "Media". This way all ROX-users can use it and we 
will have a better chance to find bugs due to (hopefully) more eyes 
looking at it. It is however downloaded and run at login, so you don't 
have to install it manually.


To install rox-desktop:

apt-get update
apt-get install rox-desktop


Before first login, a user should remove the directory ~/.rox4debian if 
it exists.

if the directory ~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net exists:
  - remove all lines after "done" in 
~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net/ROX-Session/Login
  - drag /usr/share/rox-desktop/Apps/Media into 
~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net/ROX-Session/AutoStart

- logout
- choose "ROX-Desktop" as session and log in again

It doesn't use .ivman anymore, but uses its private config directory 
inside Media's appdir.

Strange. Maybe it has to do with 0install? Doesn't happen here with 
0install 0.20.

I don't include any default run actions. They are set automatically by 
rox-menu-method. Every time you install some new software (via apt), the 
menu-method reads the .desktop-files in /usr/share/applications and sets 
system-wide run-actions and sendto-items.

That's a bug in ROX-Filer that was recently fixed. It's because some 
.desktop-files don't have an Exec-entry like e.g. "abiword %F" (%F 
indicates it can open files) but just "abiword". The next filer release 
will fix this issue.
If you don't want to wait, you can get ROX-Filer from svn. Just type:

svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rox/trunk/rox rox

and create a script ~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net/ROX-Session/RunROX

which looks something like this:

#! /bin/sh
/path/to/ROX-Filer/AppRun -S

and make it executable. Then restart ROX-Session.

If nobody else wants to do it, I'll have a look how it's done and how 
much time it would take.
But I'd prefer if somebody else did, so I can concentrate on rox4debian 
and the Media-app.

Don't know. I thought you just needed mplayer >= 0.90. At least the 
README of VideoThumbnails says so.

Note that you should never need to delete .cache to make anything
work. All deleting it will do is make you need to download things
again.

(Because things in the cache are currently owned by you, it is
possible to edit them and thus break it if you try hard enough.
However, you can detect changes with '0store verify' and in future
I'll get it to put them somewhere read-only, so I'd only delete it as
a last resort.)

Most likely the rox.sf.net web-site was down briefly.

$ 0launch --feed rox/ROX-Filer.xml

is easier, and will work with any other application that tries to run
ROX-Filer too. It will also automatically stop using the svn version
if a newer release comes out and you don't update it, as it just adds
the svn version to the existing list of available versions to choose
from.

I can make the actual release package. Mainly it just needs someone
with a little time to announce the dates and generally keep it on
track.
