Sorry, that should be ~/.cache/0install.net/implementations (where the
actual programs are stored). Other cached things under .cache *can*
change and deleting them is one way to force a refresh.

Deleting 'interfaces' isn't a great idea, though, because if any of
the sites are down then you still can't run their programs until they
come back up! An easier way is to use:

$ 0launch -g

and set the freshness to 'Up to 1 hour old'. Then log out and back in
again and the injector will check for updates for everything. If any
can't be fetched then you'll see an error message, but you'll still be
able to run them.

I just installed 1.7 on my main machine and I think I
was imagining things being downloaded twice except
rox-lib2, but I wasn't taking note of the versions so
maybe they're different?

I can't download 'System' at the moment- it says

Error downloading 'system-1.9.1.tar.bz2':

Error downloading
'http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/rox/system-1.9.1.tar.bz2':
<urlopen error (111, 'Connection refused')>

but everything else I tried downloading with 0install
was OK

Sounds great, but thats not the actual command I need
is it? Well it doesn't work for me. How should the
rox/ROX-Filer.xml bit really read?

I've not tried running rox as a different user yet but
seeing as all the progs are downloaded into my home
dir I'm presuming that each user on the system who
wants to use ROX will have to download their own
version of ROX filer etc? I hope I'm wrong on this!

'Announce the dates'? You've lost me again Thomas.
Good to have you on the list though!

Should work now. The "osdn" site has been down for ages, but I've
switched it to 'kent'.

Sorry, you still need the 'svn co' bit to actually get it. But use the
--feed command to register it rather than editing scripts.

Copy ~/.cache/0install.net/implementations/* to
/var/cache/0install.net/implementations to share them. If you don't
quite trust the user you're copying from, use '0store verify' to check
that the copy's contents matches the name of the directory. The plan
is to make this copy-and-check automatic one day, so all downloads are
shared without anyone needing root access.

You have to pick a release date, announce it, encourge people to test
the svn version, and keep track of who you're waiting for (a
translator who needs an extra day, or someone with an important patch,
etc). See:

  http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/node/193

Leaving me to organise releases is a bad idea because I get distracted
and forget to do anything ;-)

How do I go about getting 4 "desktops" working. I'm looking at my
default setup, and I have 3.

I'm testing rox-desktop to replace WindowMaker, which I have 4 on.

Thanks

Go to Apps/Configuration/Window-Manager/Workspaces. I changed the 
default to 4, so just deleting ~/.config/OroboROX and logging back in 
should also do.

Hello,

When I run "update-menus" I get this error-message:

  /tmp/roxmenu: line 204: New -rv: command not found

Line 204 of /tmp/roxmenu contains the following:

  package="rxvt-unicode" section="/Debian/XShells/Rxvt-Unicode (Black,Xft)" title="Rxvt-Unicode (Black,Xft)" longtitle="Rxvt-Unicode: terminal emulator for X" command="urxvt -fn "xft:Courier New" -rv" icon="/usr/share/pixmaps/urxvt.xpm" /usr/share/rox-menu-method/create-app-dir.sh

The installed version of rox-menu-methods is "rox-menu-method_1-4_all.deb".


BTW, rox4debian is a great project :-)

Thanks. edited it, and now working.

Next question.

How do I create icons/program link inside the "Apps -> debian -> apps"
folder?

When I drag/drop an application in there, I keep getting "Error:
permission denied."

The Apps folder is located at /usr/share/rox-desktop, so it's only 
writable by root. The "Debian" folder and all its contents is 
auto-generated by rox-menu-method, so you shouldn't put anything there 
manually.
If you want to add apps as a user, create a folder ~/Apps and place your 
applications there.

Sorry, I renamed "rox-filer" to "rox-desktop". But "rox-filer" didn't 
get removed when upgrading. So I've just renamed it back. You should 
remove /etc/menu-methods/rox-desktop after installing the new version 
1-6. I hope it works now.

I don't see any error-messages this time. Thanks!

Another thing that I noticed is that after upgrading
rox-desktop/rox-menu-method, I can't find any icons anymore for ROX-Session
or Edit in "/usr/share/rox-desktop/Apps".

Any reasson why this has changed?

To make it more clear:

- Before upgrading, it looks like this
  <http://janw.wisclub.org/nanoblogger/archives/2006/05/#e2006-05-31T23_22_07.txt>

- After upgrading, it looks like this

I've split the rox-desktop package up into three:

rox-desktop-core
provides only the login script and wrappers for ROX-Filer, OroboROX, 
ROX-Session, Find, Edit, Archive, the applets for the default panel and 
some config-apps. It is for people who don't want ivman and rox-menu-method.

rox-desktop
provides wrappers for Media, Tail, System, some more applets and 
config-apps, gmrun, gnome-system-tools, bum and synaptic. It depends on 
rox-desktop-core, ivman, rox-menu-method and some other. The 
non-ROX-apps that are wrapped are only "recommended" and installed on 
demand when clicking the app's icon.

rox-desktop-full
is an empty package that depends on rox-desktop and some useful apps 
(i.e. firefox, thunderbird, gxine, graveman...) to allow one to install 
a fully-featured desktop environment with only one command.

However, I somehow forgot to add rox-desktop-core to the dependencies of 
rox-desktop. Version 2-3 should fix this.

OK, I see. Thanks for the explanation.

Sorry, I forgot to upload the new Packages.gz and Sources.gz files. It 
should work now.

I have the latest version of rox-desktop and ivman
installed on this kanotix box. I can mount/unmount
optical discs OK, but I get an error when I try
unmounting any USB disks like this:

-------------------

Unmounting /media/sda1
umount: /media/sda1 is not in the fstab (and you are
not root)
Unmount failed

Done
There was one error.

---------------------

The fstab looks like this:

------------------------------------

The ivman daemon is running and I've tried it with and
without that sda1 entry in mtab but I still get the
same error. I have no problems with usb discs on my
other kanotix machine which has an identical fstab
file but it isn't running the very latest version of
rox-desktop and I wouldn't want to upgrade it until I
know usb support works.

I don't suppose anyone has wrote any FAQs or HOWTOs on
rox4debian yet have they? The first one should be on
getting ivman and removeable drives behaving properly
as I keep on having different problems it seems.

Thanks,

Dan

The kanotix box I was having problems with the
unmounting of USB disks seems to be working OK now.
apt-get dist-upgrade sorted it out. Sorry for causing
a fuss over nothing.

Subject: [Rox4debian-users] New version of ROX4Debian available
Message-ID: <44A2B32B.8080204@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

Hi!

I've uploaded the new versions of all my rox4debian packages.


main changes:

- replaced gmrun and gksu with my new app "Execute", because of gksu's 
big amount of dependencies

- added ROXTerm, Trashcan

- wrapper for Mail-application

- Web-Brower / Terminal / Mail wrappers now use  
~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net/handlers, so they can be different for 
different users

- lighter gtk-theme by default

- i18n for dialogs such as logout, halt, reboot and run as root 
(currently only german)


Add this to your /etc/apt/sources.list (if you haven't already):
deb ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/rox4debian binary/


To upgrade, simply type (as root):
apt-get update
apt-get install rox-desktop rox-desktop-core rox-menu-method


If you want to help with translation, you can find templates here:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/rox4debian/i18n


Greetings,

Dennis
