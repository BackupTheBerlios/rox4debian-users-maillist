Subject: [Rox4debian-users] Will it work with Ubuntu?
Message-ID: <7224a92b0611151816n458ee176v9b85dcc3acdd4dc2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I'm trying to build a desktop based on rox and beryl window manager. I
would like to know if the rox4debian repo shoulf work with ubuntu.

If not, how should I proceed? Should I use 0install? How can I an a
rox-desktop entry in gdm that proceed to install the various parts of
rox-desktop upon first login (like in debian)

Thanks, rox is awesome!

Probably best to try and see what happens. It seems to install with
edgy, although I've only tried it in a chroot within a Debian system.
I didn't manage to get rox-menu-method due to a file conflict:

dpkg: error processing
/var/cache/apt/archives/rox-xdg-defaults_1_all.deb (--unpack):
 trying to overwrite `/usr/share/applications/defaults.list', which is
also in package desktop-file-utils
Errors were encountered while processing:
 /var/cache/apt/archives/rox-xdg-defaults_1_all.deb

Also, I couldn't start hal (hangs), but that's probably due to the
chroot. Apart from that, I was able to run 'rox', browse to
/usr/share/rox-desktop/ and run the applications.

You may need to use the 'sudo passwd' trick to set a root password
while setting up ROX-Session if you want "ROX" to appear on the main
login screen. Hopefuly someone can contribute a patch for ROX-Session
so this isn't needed.

Let us know if it works...

I've fixed this for the next release by prepending
"/usr/share/rox-desktop/share" to XDG_DATA_DIRS on login and placing the
defaults in the "applications" subdirectory. rox-xdg-defaults is now
obsolete.
I'll try to make a new release soon.

A login-script is included in rox4debian, so there's no need to set it
up via ROX-Session. It's better to use the included script, because it
does some rox4debian-specific things (like setting some env variables).
You might still need a root password though, because the rox-reboot and
rox-halt wrappers as well as the sysconfig-wrappers ask for it.
Does anybody know how to figure out whether to use su or sudo?
