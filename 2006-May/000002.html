<PRE>Sorry Dennis, there are still a few kinks to be ironed
out in ROX4Debian. I'm happy to see TL has updated the
Debian install instructions but it seems strange that
he included an extract from one of DT's replies to one
of my e-mails without including what it is he's
replying to. Just looks a bit strange.

&gt;<i> Install instructions:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) move ~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net out of the
</I>&gt;<i> way. (Sorry, I'll try 
</I>&gt;<i> to avoid this next time!)
</I>
I did that before logging into v5 but there was still
no taskbar so I deleted all of ~/.config, ~/.cache and
~/.ivman before logging in again. After 0install did
its stuff I DID have a working Taskbar- yippee!

BUT

* ROX-Lib.png and SystemTrayN both failed to download
(didn't bother me though)

* I noticed that the Taskbar has its own libwnck so
two copies of libwnck (I go blind if I carry on like
this :) get downloaded. Why can't Taskbar use the same
libwnck as everything else?

* 2 ROX-Session icons appear on a fresh install- one
on the desktop and one on the panel. Just the panel
one for me please (and on the far left to keep
ex-windows addicts happy why not?)

* Why does the pager only default to be 3 desktops
wide? The unix standard has been 4 virtual desktops
since Christ used fvwm :D Bring back my 4th desktop!

Additionally, I'd like to see the Wallpaper app added
to the standard Apps link collection

We'll get there!

dan
