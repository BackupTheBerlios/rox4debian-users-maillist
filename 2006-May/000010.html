<PRE>Hi Dennis!

I noticed r4d 1.7 has been released so I just had a
very quick go with it. This time I deleted .config and
.cache to see what the new defaults are like. There
was no .ivman to delete

* Automounting seems to be working again (got to test
KDE with ivman enabled see if its still causing
problems- not that thats a major thing wrt this
project really)

* The png icons for ROX-filer and oroborox failed to
download (again, no biggie) and I got a big error that
I can't remember when rox-filer was downloading but it
downloaded OK. Also, everything seemed to get
downloaded twice for some reason?

* Glad to see the return of 4 desktops on the pager

* Please add Wallpaper to the default Apps

* It seems that you do include default run actions for
most file types but pretty much the only one that
works is using gnumeric for .xls files. For Abiword
(.doc), xpdf, pics (gthumb) I have to set it myself to


abiword &quot;$@&quot;

etc. By default, clicking on a .doc/.pdf/whatever will
open abiword/xpdf/whatever but the document will not
be opened too, just the program.

Thomas Leonard said that anyone can organise a new
release of rox-filer. I suppose we should ask on
rox-devel first to see if anybody else is already
doing it/wants to do it but if not might you create
the next release so we will have SOAP support?

Also, what packages need to be installed to get video
thumbnails working properly, especially for mplayer.
