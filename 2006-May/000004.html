</I>I gave up on packaging rox apps directly for debian, because it's a 
packaging and maintaining nightmare: Due to the debian policy, you have 
to spread an appdir across the whole filesystem and often patch the app 
in many places.
And you have to package every new version, which causes delays and often 
new problems.

So my new approach is to just put wrappers into 
/usr/share/rox-desktop/Apps which use the 0install-system in order to 
run/update. I even don't use the rox-filer package that is in debian. I 
just include a login-script that runs ROX-Session (and therefore 
ROX-Filer) through 0install.

The main advantages are that a user gets new versions of apps 
immediately when they are released, and that I can concentrate on other 
things (e.g. automounting via ivman/hal and auto-generated 
appdir-wrappers for the debian-menu-system) than repackaging apps and 
fix package-related bugs.

</I>No, I don't have any connections to debian packagers.
I haven't tried to put it into debian, because its status is still quite 
experimental and I'm not an official debian-maintainer. Once it has 
reached a certain degree of stability I'll try to become one and add it.

However, I'm still not sure if it fully complies to the debian policy, 
because it uses 0install, which adds a different way of installing 
software to debian, which - as someone pointed out on the mailing list 
of the old rox-in-debian project - isn't allowed. I think I'll have to 
read the policy again.
