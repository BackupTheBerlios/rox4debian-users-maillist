</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I noticed r4d 1.7 has been released so I just had a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very quick go with it. This time I deleted .config and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; .cache to see what the new defaults are like.
</I>
Note that you should never need to delete .cache to make anything
work. All deleting it will do is make you need to download things
again.

(Because things in the cache are currently owned by you, it is
possible to edit them and thus break it if you try hard enough.
However, you can detect changes with '0store verify' and in future
I'll get it to put them somewhere read-only, so I'd only delete it as
a last resort.)

&gt;<i> &gt; * The png icons for ROX-filer and oroborox failed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; download (again, no biggie) and I got a big error that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can't remember when rox-filer was downloading but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; downloaded OK. Also, everything seemed to get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; downloaded twice for some reason?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Strange. Maybe it has to do with 0install? Doesn't happen here with
</I>&gt;<i> 0install 0.20.
</I>
Most likely the rox.sf.net web-site was down briefly.
[...]
&gt;<i> If you don't want to wait, you can get ROX-Filer from svn. Just type:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> svn co <A HREF="https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rox/trunk/rox">https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rox/trunk/rox</A> rox
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and [...]
</I>
$ 0launch --feed rox/ROX-Filer.xml

is easier, and will work with any other application that tries to run
ROX-Filer too. It will also automatically stop using the svn version
if a newer release comes out and you don't update it, as it just adds
the svn version to the existing list of available versions to choose
from.

&gt;<i> &gt; Thomas Leonard said that anyone can organise a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; release of rox-filer. I suppose we should ask on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rox-devel first to see if anybody else is already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doing it/wants to do it but if not might you create
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the next release so we will have SOAP support?
</I>&gt;<i> If nobody else wants to do it, I'll have a look how it's done and how
</I>&gt;<i> much time it would take.
</I>&gt;<i> But I'd prefer if somebody else did, so I can concentrate on rox4debian
</I>&gt;<i> and the Media-app.
</I>
I can make the actual release package. Mainly it just needs someone
with a little time to announce the dates and generally keep it on
track.
